# CS-330

This project solidified my design process, which emphasizes planning and clear documentation. I honed my ability to translate ideas into actionable steps and made informed decisions throughout the development of the project.  While I previously focused on functionality first, this project highlighted the importance of user experience and visual appeal with emphasis on manuverability lighting and texturing which highlights my stylistic approach. Moving forward, I'll learn from how I navigated and circumvented specifc directions to create my own interpretation of the project by continously building on to what I make in iterations. On the development side, I embraced the power of iteration and creativity. Experimenting with code allowed me to refine my approach and troubleshoot challenges effectively while maintaining a specifc life like style. My coding style has continued to be more modular and reusable, promoting cleaner code and easier maintenance. I don't personally believe that this project has brought to light any specifics on my future with computer science as I'm moving twoards a more analytical approach in my carreer but it still lets me appreciate the amount of effort that goes into creating games and specific visualizations and helps me better understand the processes behind it all.
